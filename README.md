**Senior Project**
<br>
This project is the back-end code for a Monitoring and Alarm System (MAS).
<br>
The MAS has four sensors: Fire, Smoke, Heat, and Static Electricity.
<br>
There is Log in screen that leads to a Main Menu. 
<br>
From the main menu the user chooses an option.
<br> 
If they choose Sensor Options, they will be presented with the Sensor Menu.
<br>
From the sensor menu they can choose a sensor, and will then be presented with the options for that sensor.
<br> 
They can view the sensor status, activate the sensor, deactivate the sensor, reset the sensor, or exit.
<br>
If they activate the sensor the status will be set to active. If they deacivate the sensor, the status will be set to inactive.
<br>
If a sensor is not active it cannot be deactivated. Likewise, a sensor can only be reset if it is active. 
<br>
An inactive sensor cannot be reset.
<br>
Choosing Exit will take the user to the previous menu, unless the user is on the Main Menu screen. In that case, the program will close.
